# Most-Interesting-Deep-Learning-Papers-Compilation
Just some compilation I've made of the papers I found most interesting.

Most of them have been downloaded from  https://arxiv.org/.

Although I recommend reading all of them, here are some topics the papers are about:

- Face Recognition
- Image Enhancement
- Person Reidentification
- Generative Learning
- Object Detection/Segmentation
- ect...




## Disclaimer
I do not take any credit for those papers. It's just a compilation of public access papers I've found intereting. Authors should get all the recognition for their work.
